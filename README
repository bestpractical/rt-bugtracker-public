NAME
    RT::BugTracker::Public - Adds a public, user-friendly bug tracking and
    reporting UI to RT

DESCRIPTION
    RT::BugTracker::Public depends on RT::BugTracker.

    RT::BugTracker::Public depends on RT::Authen::Bitcard and
    Authen::Bitcard for external authentication through Bitcard.

    NB: External authentication through Bitcard is broken in RT 4.2 and 4.4.
    The authors may eventually deprecate this functionality.

    This extension adds a public interface for searching and reporting bugs
    through an RT with RT::BugTracker installed. The public reporting UI is
    disabled, by default.

    The public interface entrypoint is on the RT login page. Click the
    public interface link to access the public bug search page. The public
    search functionality is identical to the private interface in
    RT::BugTracker.

    To enable public bug reporting, follow the documentation for
    WebPublicUserReporting, in the CONFIGURATION section, below. To report
    bugs, public users must create a new ticket using the New ticket in
    button, or click Report a new bug from the bug list page for a
    distribution.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::BugTracker::Public');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    You can find local/etc/BugTracker-Public/RT_SiteConfig.pm with example
    of configuration and sane defaults. Add require in the main
    RT_SiteConfig.pm or define options there.

  WebPublicUser
    Create the public user in your RT system through Admin \ Users \>
    Create> in RT. The public user must be able to access RT, and it must be
    privileged so it can have rights. Do not enter an email address for the
    public user.

    Add the line below to RT_SiteConfig.pm and replace 'guest' with the name
    of the RT user you just created.

        Set( $WebPublicUser, 'guest' );

    The public user needs the following rights on public distribution queues
    to search bugs:

        SeeCustomField
        SeeQueue
        ShowTicket

    The pubic user needs the following rights on public distribution queues
    to report bugs:

        CreateTicket
        ModifyCustomField
        ReplyToTicket

  WebPublicUserReporting
    By default, the web public user cannot create bug reports through the
    web UI. To allow this, add this line:

        Set($WebPublicUserReporting, 1);
