NAME
    RT::BugTracker::Public - Adds a public, (hopefully) userfriendly bug
    tracking UI to RT

CONFIGURATION
    You can find local/etc/BugTracker-Public/RT_SiteConfig.pm with example
    of configuration and sane defaults. Add require in the main
    RT_SiteConfig.pm or define options there.

  WebPublicUser
    Make sure to create the public user in your RT system and add the line
    below to your RT_SiteConfig.pm.

        Set( $WebPublicUser, 'guest' );

    If you didn't name your public user 'guest', then change accordingly.

    The public user should probably be unprivileged and have the following
    rights

        CreateTicket
        ModifyCustomField
        ReplyToTicket
        SeeCustomField
        SeeQueue
        ShowTicket

    If you want the public UI to do anything useful. It should NOT have the
    ModifySelf right.
