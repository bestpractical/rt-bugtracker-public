Make sure to create the public user in your RT system and add the line below
to your RT_SiteConfig.pm.

Set( $WebPublicUser, 'guest' );

If you didn't name your public user 'guest', then change accordingly.


The public user should probably be unprivileged and have the following rights

    CreateTicket
    ModifyCustomField
    ReplyToTicket
    SeeCustomField
    SeeQueue
    ShowTicket

if you want the public UI to do anything useful.  It should NOT have the
ModifySelf right.
