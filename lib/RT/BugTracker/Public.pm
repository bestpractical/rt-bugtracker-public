=head1 NAME

RT::BugTracker::Public - Adds a public, user-friendly bug tracking and
reporting UI to RT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT::BugTracker::Public depends on RT::BugTracker.

RT::BugTracker::Public depends on RT::Authen::Bitcard and
Authen::Bitcard for external authentication through Bitcard.

NB: External authentication through Bitcard is broken in RT 4.2 and
4.4. The authors may eventually deprecate this functionality.

This extension adds a public interface for searching and reporting
bugs through an RT with RT::BugTracker installed. The public reporting
UI is disabled, by default.

The public interface entrypoint is on the RT login page. Click the
C<public interface> link to access the public bug search page. The
public search functionality is identical to the private interface in
RT::BugTracker.

To enable public bug reporting, follow the documentation for
C<WebPublicUserReporting>, in the C<CONFIGURATION> section, below. To
report bugs, public users must create a new ticket using the C<New
ticket in> button, or click C<Report a new bug> from the bug list page
for a distribution.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item C<make initdb>

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

Add this line:

    Plugin('RT::BugTracker::Public');

=item Clear your mason cache

    rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

=item Restart your webserver

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You can find F<local/etc/BugTracker-Public/RT_SiteConfig.pm> with example of
configuration and sane defaults. Add require in the main F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> or
define options there.

=head2 WebPublicUser

Create the public user in your RT system through F<Admin \> Users \>
Create> in RT. The public user must be able to access RT, and it must
be privileged so it can have rights. Do not enter an email address for
the public user.

Add the line below to F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> and replace 'guest' with the
name of the RT user you just created.

    Set( $WebPublicUser, 'guest' );

The public user needs the following rights on public distribution
queues to search bugs:

    SeeCustomField
    SeeQueue
    ShowTicket

The pubic user needs the following rights on public distribution
queues to report bugs:

    CreateTicket
    ModifyCustomField
    ReplyToTicket

=head2 WebPublicUserReporting

By default, the web public user cannot create bug reports through the
web UI. To allow this, add this line:

    Set($WebPublicUserReporting, 1);

=head2 WebPublicUserQueryBuilder

By default, the web public user cannot use RT's fully-featured query builder
and is limited instead to simple search. To allow access to the query
builder, add this line:

    Set($WebPublicUserQueryBuilder, 1);

=head2 WebPublicUserSortResults

By default, the web public user cannot click column headers to re-sort search
results due to performance implications. To permit this, add this line:

    Set($WebPublicUserSortResults, 1);

=head2 ScrubInlineArticleContent

By default, inline articles such as AfterLoginForm are scrubbed for unsafe
HTML tags just like ticket correspondence. If your articles are modifiable
only by trusted users, you may set this to 0 to pass through article content
unscrubbed.

See the documentation below for L</GetArticleContent> for more information.

    Set($ScrubInlineArticleContent, 0);
